# unix-networking-in-c

A low-level TCP server written in C for UNIX systems, built while working through *UNIX Network Programming*.

The project focuses on understanding core networking primitives such as sockets, `fork()`-based concurrency, POSIX signal handling, and blocking I/O semantics, without relying on frameworks or higher-level abstractions.

This repository serves as a learning and reference implementation for how real UNIX servers operate at the system-call level.
